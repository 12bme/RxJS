# RxJS - The Reactive Extensions for JavaScript

## Contributing ##

There are lots of ways to contribute to the project, and we appreciate our [contributors](https://github.com/Reactive-Extensions/RxJS/wiki/Contributors).  If you wish to contribute, check out our [style guide]((https://github.com/Reactive-Extensions/RxJS/tree/master/doc/contributing)).

You can contribute by reviewing and sending feedback on code checkins, suggesting and trying out new features as they are implemented, submit bugs and help us verify fixes as they are checked in, as well as submit code fixes or code contributions of your own. Note that all code submissions will be rigorously reviewed and tested by the Rx Team, and only those that meet an extremely high bar for both quality and design/roadmap appropriateness will be merged into the source.

First-time contributors must sign a [Contribution License Agreement](https://cla.microsoft.com/).  If your Pull Request has the label [cla-required](https://github.com/Reactive-Extensions/RxJS/labels/cla-required), this is an indication that you haven't yet signed such an agreement.
